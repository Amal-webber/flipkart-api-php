PHP Wrapper for Flipkart API
============================
A simple PHP wrapper for the official Flipkart API

Flipkart recently launched a [Product Feeds API](http://www.flipkart.com/affiliate/apifaq) (still in beta). There isn't any official wrappers for PHP (yet?) - so I decided to go ahead and build one.

The API seems complicated to use, but I've managed to build a simple demo where you can select a category, and products in the category that are in stock are displayed in a table.

For the demo to work, you'll need to generate an access token through your [affiliate account](http://www.flipkart.com/affiliate/).

Feel free to use it, fork it, and send pull requests!
